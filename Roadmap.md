# 📜 AI-Powered D&D Scenario Bot - Development Roadmap

## 🔥 Project Overview
An AI-powered Discord bot that generates dynamic D&D adventure scenarios and allows players to interact with them using RPG mechanics like dice rolling and character stats.

---

## ✅ 1️⃣ Foundation (Completed)
✔️ Set up the GitHub repository  
✔️ Created initial `README.md`  
✔️ Added `LICENSE`  
✔️ Created `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files  
✔️ Configured `.env` for API keys (Discord & OpenAI)  
✔️ Implemented proper `.env` loading  
✔️ Fixed missing `requirements.txt` and ensured dependencies are installed  

---

## ✅ 2️⃣ Core Gameplay Mechanics (Completed)
✔️ Implemented `!adventure` command to generate AI-powered scenarios  
✔️ Implemented `!choose` command to allow players to make choices  
✔️ Tracked player choices and stored history  
✔️ Implemented basic player registration with `!register`  
✔️ Implemented `!stats` to display player attributes  
✔️ Implemented a `!roll d20` command for dice rolls  
✔️ Fixed bugs related to Discord token recognition and player tracking  
✔️ Ensured choices are stored properly and verified `!stats` and `!choose` commands function correctly

## 🚀 3️⃣ Intelligent Decision Tracking & Persistence (In Progress)
🔲 Implement rate-limiting and caching to optimize API calls and reduce quota usage  
🔲 Modify `!choose` to factor in **dice rolls** before resolving the outcome  
🔲 Apply **player stats bonuses** to dice rolls (e.g., Strength affects combat)  
🔲 Implement **Basic Decision Tracking** – Store past choices to influence future scenarios  
🔲 Implement **Adventure Continuity** – Allow past choices to persist across multiple play sessions  
🔲 Store player choices in a database (e.g., SQLite) instead of memory  

---

## 🛠 4️⃣ AI-Enhanced Gameplay Features (Planned)
🔲 Interactive NPCs – Introduce pre-defined AI personalities (e.g., grumpy warrior, wise scholar)  
🔲 Memory System – NPCs remember past player interactions  
🔲 AI-Powered Task Optimization – Allow AI to balance difficulty dynamically based on past choices  
🔲 Dynamic Encounter Scaling – AI modifies challenge difficulty based on player performance  
🔲 Enable AI-generated encounters to scale based on character stats  

---

## 📊 5️⃣ Data Visualization & Analytics (Planned)
🔲 Create a Power BI or dashboard system to visualize player trends and choices  
🔲 Track decision pathways, encounter success rates, and player stats progression  
🔲 Adventure Trend Tracking – Log player choices to analyze common play styles  

---

## 🎲 6️⃣ Expanded RPG Mechanics (Planned)
🔲 Implement an experience points (XP) system for leveling  
🔲 Enable AI-generated challenges to factor in dice rolls + character stats  
🔲 Introduce inventory tracking for items and rewards  

---

## 🌐 7️⃣ GitHub & Documentation (Planned)
🔲 Maintain detailed documentation for future contributors  
🔲 Create a guide on setting up the bot locally  
🔲 Add example prompts and structured data for training AI responses  

---

## 🏁 8️⃣ Final Features & Testing (Planned)
🔲 Beta Testing with Multiple Users – Gather feedback & adjust mechanics  
🔲 Refine OpenAI Prompts for Better Storytelling – Fine-tune adventure generation quality  
🔲 Optimize Performance & Final API Cost Review – Ensure sustainable long-term usage  
🔲 Final Documentation & Deployment – Wrap up guides for public use
