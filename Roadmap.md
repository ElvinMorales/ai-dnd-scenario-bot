# üìú AI-Powered D&D Scenario Bot - Development Roadmap

## üî• Project Overview

An AI-powered Discord bot that generates dynamic D&D adventure scenarios, enabling players to experience interactive narratives with traditional RPG mechanics. The bot leverages OpenAI models to produce creative content and intelligent outcomes.

## ‚úÖ Completed Milestones

- **Foundation:**
  - Set up the GitHub repository, initial README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
  - Configured environment variables via `.env` for Discord and OpenAI API keys.
  - Created `requirements.txt` for dependency management.

- **Core Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - Implemented `!adventure` command for AI-generated scenarios.
  - Developed `!choose` command for interactive decision-making.
  - Added basic dice rolling with `!roll d20`.
  - Built player registration and stat tracking (`!register` and `!stats`).
  - Integrated cooldown systems to prevent command spam.

## üöÄ In Progress (Immediate Next Steps)

### 1. Intelligent Decision Tracking & Persistence
- **Player Stat Bonuses & Dice Rolls:**  
  - **Task:** Integrate player stat modifiers into the dice rolling function.
  - **Status:** Completed.

- **Expanded Character Stats:**
  - **Task:** Update the `!register` command to generate a full D&D 5e character with six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) and calculate HP dynamically using Constitution.
  - **Status:** Completed.
  
- **Revised Dice Roll Commands:**
  - **Task:** Modify `!roll d20` so that if no ability is provided it returns a plain roll, and if an ability is specified, it applies the corresponding modifier.
  - **Status:** Completed.
  
- **Updated Stats Display:**
  - **Task:** Update `!stats` command to show all six abilities along with their calculated modifiers and the current HP.
  - **Status:** Completed.

- **Database Integration:**  
  - **Task:** Implement SQLite to store player choices and history persistently.
  - **Status:** Completed.
  
### 2. Documentation & Code Quality Enhancements
- **Update Documentation:**  
  - **Task:** Ensure README and inline comments are current with new features.
  - **Status:** Ongoing.

- **Code Refactoring:**  
  - **Task:** Remove debugging code and clean up command handlers.
  - **Status:** Completed.

- **Testing:**
  - **Task:** Conduct further testing of new features, including edge cases (e.g., unregistered users using modifier commands) and refine any remaining bugs.
  - **Estimated Timeline:** Ongoing.
