# 🛠 AI-Powered D&D Scenario Bot - Development Roadmap

## ✅ 1️⃣ Foundation (Completed)
✔️ Set up the GitHub repository  
✔️ Configured Python environment & dependencies  
✔️ Built the basic Discord bot  
✔️ Integrated OpenAI for AI-generated adventures  
✔️ Implemented API optimizations (cooldowns, caching, structured prompts)  

---

## ✅ 2️⃣ Core Gameplay Mechanics (Completed)
✔️ Implemented Dice Rolling (`!roll d20`) – Allows skill checks and combat.  
✔️ Implemented Player Choices (`!choose 1/2/3`) – Links choices to AI-generated scenarios.  
✔️ Added Player Stats Tracking (`!register`, `!stats`) – Stores Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and HP.

## 🚀 3️⃣ Intelligent Decision Tracking & Persistence (In Progress)
🔲 Modify `!choose` to factor in **dice rolls** before resolving the outcome.  
🔲 Apply **player stats bonuses** to dice rolls (e.g., Strength affects combat).  
🔲 Implement **Basic Decision Tracking** – Store past choices to influence future scenarios.  
🔲 Implement **Adventure Continuity** – Allow past choices to persist across multiple play sessions.  

---

## 🛠 4️⃣ AI-Enhanced Gameplay Features (Planned)
🔲 Interactive NPCs – Introduce pre-defined AI personalities (e.g., grumpy warrior, wise scholar).  
🔲 Memory System – NPCs remember past player interactions.  
🔲 AI-Powered Task Optimization – Allow AI to balance difficulty dynamically based on past choices.  
🔲 Dynamic Encounter Scaling – AI modifies challenge difficulty based on player performance.  

---

## 📊 5️⃣ Data Visualization & Analytics (Planned)
🔲 Adventure Trend Tracking – Log player choices to analyze common play styles.  
🔲 Decision Pathways & Encounter Data – Store & visualize stats using Power BI or Python dashboards.  
🔲 Power BI Integration (Stretch Goal) – Create a real-time dashboard to analyze in-game data.  

---

## 🔗 6️⃣ Final Features & Testing (Planned)
🔲 Beta Testing with Multiple Users – Gather feedback & adjust mechanics.  
🔲 Refine OpenAI Prompts for Better Storytelling – Fine-tune adventure generation quality.  
🔲 Optimize Performance & Final API Cost Review – Ensure sustainable long-term usage.  
🔲 Final Documentation & Deployment – Wrap up guides for public use.
