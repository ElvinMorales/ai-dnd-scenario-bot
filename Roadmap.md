# 🛠 AI-Powered D&D Scenario Bot - Development Roadmap

## ✅ 1️⃣ Foundation (Completed)
✔️ Set up the GitHub repository  
✔️ Configured Python environment & dependencies  
✔️ Built the basic Discord bot  
✔️ Integrated OpenAI for AI-generated adventures  
✔️ Implemented API optimizations (cooldowns, caching, structured prompts)  

---

## 🚀 2️⃣ Core Gameplay Mechanics (In Progress)
🔲 Implement Character Stats (!register, !stats) – Track Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, etc.
🔲 Modify !choose to Use Dice Rolls (!roll d20) – Players roll for success/failure based on their stats.
🔲 AI-Driven Success/Failure Outcomes – AI tailors responses based on roll results. 

---

## 🎲 3️⃣ AI & Mechanics Integration
🔲 AI generates scenarios and choices dynamically.
🔲 Players choose (!choose 1/2/3), triggering a dice roll (!roll d20).
🔲 Character stats modify rolls (e.g., Strength affects combat rolls).
🔲 AI determines outcomes based on roll success/failure.

---

## 🛠 4️⃣ Advanced Character Progression & Memory
🔲 Implement XP & Leveling – Players improve stats over time.
🔲 Track player decisions and apply them to future encounters.
🔲 Persistent World Mechanics – Past choices shape future AI-generated adventures. 

---

## 📊 5️⃣ Data Visualization & Analytics
🔲 Track player choices, dice rolls, and adventure outcomes.
🔲 Develop basic stat dashboards (Power BI, Grafana, or Python-based tracking).
🔲 Monitor game balance and difficulty scaling trends.

---

## 🔗 6️⃣ Final Features & Testing
🔲 Beta Testing with Multiple Users – Gather feedback & refine mechanics.
🔲 Optimize API Usage & Costs – Ensure long-term sustainability.
🔲 Final Documentation & Public Release – Wrap up guides for new users & contributors.
